## Why start a blog?

1. Practice writing through repition.
  * Writing is a skill that needs practice, like any other.
  * Simplifying complex topics is a core competency for data scientists.
2. Explore things I find cool.
  * Same way writing a thesis forces you to finish a project.
3. Condense my knowledge by writing about it.
  * The best way to learn and to ensure that you understand something 
  is to condense it and/or teach it to others.
