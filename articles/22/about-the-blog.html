<div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didnâ€™t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas wonâ€™t just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, thatâ€™s why I write them.</p><footer>Paul Graham, <cite> "Putting Ideas into Words" </cite></footer></blockquote></div>
<p><span class="newthought">This is not my first attempt</span>  at blogging, I have a bad habit of setting these up and then nuking them after a while because Iâ€™m not happy with the look and feel (my graphic design skills leave a lot to be desired). Which is a pity, I think expressing yourself is a genuinely useful skill and they only way to get better at anything is to practice. However,  due to my natural engineer aversion to writing, I have let this languish.</p>

<p>This time Iâ€™ve decided to put the effort in and get a setup I actually like <label for="one" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="one" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Sidenotes!!! </span> (more on this in a moment). Iâ€™m fairly happy with the current look and feel itâ€™s got all the bells and whistles like pretentious epigraphs and my beloved sidenotes. <label for="one" class="margin-toggle"> âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="one" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Fighting the urge to change things to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiated_initial">historiated initial</a> at the start of every post, like this is an illuminated manuscript and not a blog. </span>There isnâ€™t actually much thatâ€™s missing, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll find someway to tinker.</p>

<h2 id="nuts-and-bolts">Nuts and Bolts</h2>

<p><span class="newthought">The theme</span>  is based on <a href="https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll">clayh53/tufte-jekyll</a> which is itself based on Edward Tufteâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. It has some great liquid tags for setting up side/margin notes, epigraphs, and various other stylish and useful bits and pieces already built in.</p>

<p>I did make some changes, most obvious is the colours. Iâ€™ve always loved the Financial Times colour scheme <label for="two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="two" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The actual physical newspaper was also <a href="https://qz.com/462285/why-the-financial-times-is-pink/">pink</a> for interesting reasons. </span> and decided to use it here as well. Besides, how often do you get the chance to use a pink background?</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Installation</span>  was relatively straightforward. I just followed the official Github Pages getting started guide and poked around a bit in the Jekyll docs. Once youâ€™re relatively on top of what Jekyll is all about download/clone/whatever the <a href="https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll">theme</a> and move all the files into your repo.  Youâ€™ll have to change the configs (pay attention to your base url especially) to match your site and do any style/template changes, and you should be off to the races. If you do change your background make sure you look at the code style background as well.</p>

<p>I did have to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> <label for="three" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="three" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This may have been a Windows problem (it normally is). </span> and add some gems to get things working correctly. You can then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve -w</code> to run and test locally.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">The aforementioned</span>  gemfile issue was solved by modifying it to:</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>

<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'rouge'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"webrick"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"~&gt; 1.7"</span>
<span class="c1"># Windows needs tzinfo for some reason</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"tzinfo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"~&gt; 2.0"</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"tzinfo-data"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"~&gt; 1.2022"</span>
<span class="c1"># jekyll serve asked for this</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'wdm'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'&gt;= 0.1.0'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Gem</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">win_platform?</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and then deleting the lock file and re-running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code>.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Deploying</span>  is also a bit tricky because Github Pages doesnâ€™t support the Liquid tags and plugins. To get around this create a new empty branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> and move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder there and commit when you want to deploy. There is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake</code> file included with the theme that will do this for you, but it is a bit dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Otherwise</span>  check out the list of <a href="https://clayh53.github.io/tufte-jekyll/articles/20/Edge-Cases">edge cases</a> and pay special attention to the quote marks you use in the liquid tags.</p>
